Description: The goal of RcppCoDA is to create a blazing fast library for the analysis of 
  compositional data with both C++ and R interfaces. 
  Beyond standard compositional data transforms, RcppCoDA features the following:
  Support for compositional arrays (e.g., posterior samples of compositional matricies);
  Transformations of Covariace Matricies (and covariance arrays);
  Support for partially compositional arrays;
  A library of functions for transforming between coordinate systems while staying in the simplex;
  The Inter-Quartile Log Ratio Transform; Proportionality Calculations (i.e., Phi Statistics).
